# Video-Semantic-Segmentation


 Image Segmentation techniques can be classified into three groups, depending on the amount and type of information they convey:

Semantic Segmentation
Instance Segmentation
Panoptic Segmentation


Usually, deep learning based segmentation models are built upon a base CNN network. A standard model such as VGG is chosen for the base network usually. Some initial layers of the base network are used in the encoder, and rest of the segmentation network is built on top of that.
